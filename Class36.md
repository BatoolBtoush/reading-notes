## **Whiteboard**

Whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview.

To do this, follow through on those advices:

- ### **Communicate**

    When asked to solve a problem, ask the interviewer to explain the problem to you, don't just write it down and stay silent. Try to be communicative and make sure you are able to explain the problem to the interviewer.

    By restating the question:

    Because you might not fully understand the question. By restating the question you might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past. 

    The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand. There is no situation in which restating the problem will hurt you — it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss. Furthermore, starting the discussion this way will help quell some nerves that might otherwise manifest while trying to solve the actual challenge.

- ### **Ask About Edge Cases**

    Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. It shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).

- ### **Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense**

    you can ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer. It’s possible they will be the type that doesn’t want to “give you hints,” but it’s also possible they’ll be more interested in how you think and want to discuss your pseudocode with you. 

    In other words, in the worst case the interviewer will tell you to continue without actually offering feedback. In the best case, the interviewer might actually point out logical flaws in your pseudocode that will give you some serious benefit when transitioning to actual code.

- ### **Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good**

    You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

- ### **Stuck? Ask for Help!**

    If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.

## **How To Ace A Programming Interview**

1. Take a few minutes.
2. Write down the steps of the solution.
3. Write pseudocode first.
4. Don’t sweat the small stuff.
5. Sit down. Be humble, For example:

    - Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
    - Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
    - How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
    - Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
    - Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
    - Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
6. Come prepared.
7. Review your work: focus on these two areas:
    - Algorithmic efficiency.
    - Correctness.
