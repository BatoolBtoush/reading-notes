>## [Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice](#Upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)
What I got from this article kind of stressed me out but at the same time comforted me a bit, why?
Because the bullet points were loud and clear, and the most significant one is:
**Get out of your comfort zone**.
<br>
</br>
Some might think that continously going over the same issues in programming has a good outcome to our accumulative knowledge, but it's actually the exact opposite, because what good could come from repeating the same procedure over and over again?
<br>
</br>
The correct way to advance and stir up the mind is to push yourself to take up more challenging codes and programming tasks, don't just stick to what you already know as that won't get you far.
<br>
</br>
### ***How to do so?***

By something called **deliberate practice**.
<br>
</br>
### ***What is meant by deliberate practice?***
And I quote directly from: [Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

"Deliberate practice are activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance."

Basically, their sole purpose is to allow you to improve your knowledge by adding new things into it, even if it could be difficult and demanding at points.

>## [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](#Carol-Dweck-on-the-Growth-Mindset)
This was such a fun and informative video to watch and it brought up many important ideas that I have thought of before but never dowelled on and I'm going to list them down:
- *The growth and fixed mindsets:*
<br>
Carol has brought to attention a very welcomed distinguish between two different states of mind; the first one suggests that it welcomes challenges and difficulty because it makes the person more engaged and ready to evolve to the level of difficulty, therefore making him/her smarter as they process every error they encounter to try learn from it and everntually correct it.
<br>
But the second mindset, views difficulties and challenges as the enemy, which makes them doubt themselves and give up easily, because they think they can't handle that kind of new thinking, so they disengage completely with errors.
<br>
- *Some people are more intrested in the NOW, while others are all about the YET:*
<br>
What this means is that when encountring any kind of difficult situations, some people would view their failure as an end to all their efforts so they give up because their NOW mentality focuses only on the current results.
<br>
While the ones with the YET prespective, view their setbacks as a chance for them to advance more because it only means that they have to change their steps to success, like putting more effort in and creating new strategies.

- *By pushing oneself out of one's comfort zone, it gives them more opprtunity to progress and deal with hardships in a more healthy manner.*

>## [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](#Angela-Lee-Duckworth-on-Grit)
This video touched again on the growth mindset but with a different title, which is grit.

Angela began discussing how was grit the only quality that made growing and achieving long term goals possible, how grit meant to overcome hurdels and setbacks for the greater good which is the future one wishes to live, because means stamina and perseverance no matter what.
<br>
</br>
Then she brought up how to develop this skill or quality in kids or even adults, and the solution came as: havign a growth mindset, which means -> To understand that the ability to learn is not fixed but can change with effort, and that makes getting up after any setback more easier because it doesn't mean the end of the world, but rather a second chance.

> ## [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](#Alain-de-Botton-on-Redefining-Success)
This video was both fun and depressing, because it stresses on how much our modern society has infected us with negative emotions that dictate our lives, like:
- **The axiety** that comes from careers and our constant worry for our place in the socail hierarchy, because in some sociaties that is what makes a person worthy or not.
- **Envy**, now envy is a very demanding emotion but what I was surprised to learn is that comes hand in hand with the sense of equality. Because if we were to feel this emotion we basically have thought about the fact that we should be equal to the person who I'm envying, that's why this emotion is only directed towards people we can relate to.
<br>
</br>

The video also touched on a very important topic, which is **meritocracy**, which means that people get exactly what they deserve. 
<br>
But what I also liked how Alain made sure to say that this idea is simply naive, because there are just too many parameters to be taken into account before we can say that someone has failed or successed purly because of his or her own work.

> ## [Measuring Emotional Intelligence](#Measuring-Emotional-Intelligence)
After taking the assessment these were my results:
| Assessment | Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Self-Awareness | 18 |
| Self-Management | 13 |
| Social Awareness | 22 |
| Relationship Management | 17 |

<br>
I think I was a bit shocked at the scores, espacially the "Self-Management", but I suppose it's true because although I am aware of what I'm doing or how I'm feeling I still tend to be blinded by the overwhelming emotions.

Other than that, I think the rest are well estimated.

> ## [Assessing Bias](#Assessing-Bias)
After taking this assessment, this was my result:

<br>
I noticed that I have some kind of a weakness when it comes to voicing my thoughts in a discomforting setting, and that is something I'll try to work on.

In addition to, working more on including others in my decision-making process.
